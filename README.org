There are several separate modules for you to read through before you're ready
to start writing code.
However, if you just want to get started right away you can skip the introduction
to hardware description languages, and jump straight to the [[./introduction.org][Intro to chisel]] which
covers the practical steps necessary to build your first circuits.
In order to get started you should go through the introductory material:
- [[./hdl.org][Introduction to hardware description languages]]
- [[./introduction.org][Introduction to hardware chisel]]

The deliverable for this exercise is constructing a matrix multiplying unit:
- [[./exercise.org][Matrix multiplier exercise]]

The main course(work) for creating a 5-stage RISCV pipeline can be found here:

If you're unsure where to start just go straight to [[./introduction.org][Intro to chisel]].
