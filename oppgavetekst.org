* Excercise Zero
  The goal of this excercise is to gain some familiarity with developing for 
  FPGAs using chisel. 
  In this exercise you will implement a circuit capable of performing matrix 
  matrix multiplication in the chisel hardware description language.
  
  HAND IN YOUR CODE IN AN ARCHIVE WITH YOUR USERNAME (e.g peteraa_ex0).
  PLEASE ENSURE THAT WHEN UNZIPPING THE TESTS CAN BE RUN.

* Your first component
  There are two types of digital components: Combinatorial and stateful.
  The first component we will consider is a simple combinatorial incrementor:
  
  #+begin_src scala
    class myIncrement(incrementBy: Int) extends Module {
      val io = IO(
        new Bundle {
          val dataIn  = Input(UInt(32.W))
          val dataOut = Output(UInt(32.W))
        }
      )

      io.dataOut := io.dataIn + incrementBy.U
  #+end_src
  
  Let's break the code down down. First, myIncrement is a Module, meaning that
  this class can be instantiated as a hardware circuit.
  Figure [rm3] shows the model that you have just declared.
  A 32 bit signal, data_in goes in, and another 32 bit signal goes out.
  
  Apart from the IO, there is only one statement, assigning dataOut to dataIn + 
  incrementBy.
  
  In RTL the component looks like fig [rm4]
  
  Let's see how we can use our module:
  #+begin_src scala
    class myIncrementTwice(incrementBy: Int) extends Module {
      val io = IO(
        new Bundle {
          val dataIn  = Input(UInt(32.W))
          val dataOut = Output(UInt(32.W))
        }
      )

      val first  = Module(new myIncrement(incrementBy))
      val second = Module(new myIncrement(incrementBy))

      first.io.dataIn  := io.dataIn
      second.io.dataIn := first.io.dataOut

      io.dataOut := second.io.dataOut
    }
  #+end_src
  
  Fig [rm5] shows the RTL design, as expected it's just two incrementors 
  chained.
  
  The following code shows off how you can use for loops to instantiate an
  arbitrary amount of modules.
  #+begin_src scala
    class myIncrementN(incrementBy: Int, numIncrementors: Int) extends Module {
      val io = IO(
        new Bundle {
          val dataIn  = Input(UInt(32.W))
          val dataOut = Output(UInt(32.W))
        }
      )

      val incrementors = Array.fill(numIncrementors){ Module(new myIncrement(incrementBy)) }

      for(ii <- 1 until numIncrementors){
        incrementors(ii).io.dataIn := incrementors(ii - 1).io.dataOut
      }

      incrementors(0).io.dataIn := io.dataIn
      io.dataOut := incrementors(numIncrementors).io.dataOut
    }
  #+end_src
  Keep in mind that the for-loop only exists at design time, just like a for loop
  generating a table in HTML will not be part of the finished HTML.
  
  So, what does combinatorial mean?
  To answer that, let's create a stateful circuit first.

  #+begin_src scala
    class myDelay() extends Module {
      val io = IO(
        new Bundle {
          val dataIn  = Input(UInt(32.W))
          val dataOut = Output(UInt(32.W))
        }
      )
      val delayReg = RegInit(UInt(32.W), 0.U)

      delayReg   := io.dataIn
      io.dataOut := delayReg
    }
  #+end_src
  
  This circuit seems rather pointless, it simply assigns the input to the output.
  However, the register has another input, as seen in the RTL: fig [rm6].
  The register can only change value during rising edges on the clock!
  
  To examplify, assume at step 0 data in is 0x45. 
  delayReg will now have 0x45 as its data in, but data out will still be 0.
  Only when the clock ticks will delayReg.dataOut take on the value 0x45.
  
  You should now be able to implement myDelayN following the same principles as
  myIncrementN
  
  #+begin_src scala
    class myDelayN(delay: Int) extends Module {
      val io = IO(
        new Bundle {
          val dataIn  = Input(UInt(32.W))
          val dataOut = Output(UInt(32.W))
        }
      )
    
      ???
    }
  #+end_src

  This should answer the initial question of combinatorial vs stateful: 
  The output of a combinatorial circuit will be available instantly, while 
  a stateful circuit will only update its output during rising edges on the 
  clock.
  
  Before you continue it is recommended that you check out the chisel3
  tutorials.
  
  In the basics.scala there is one more module, a basic selector.
  At compile time this component builds n random numbers, to see which we can
  cycle through them.
  The component comes with a test, this test will be run when you do sbt.run
  You should study this component. What is the difference between if/else and 
  when/otherwise?
  
* Matrix matrix multiplication
  When designing digital logic you should always start with decomposition.
  Your first task is therefore to implement a dot product calculator, since 
  a matrix matrix multiplication is essentially a series of these.
  
* Dot Prod
  First, let's consider how a dot product calculator would look like in regular
  scala:
  
  #+begin_src scala

    val vecA = List(1,  2, 4)
    val vecB = List(2, -3, 1)

    val dotProductForLoop = {
      var dotProduct = 0
      for(i <- 0 until vecA.length){
        dotProduct = dotProduct + (vecA(i) * vecB(i))
      }
      dotProduct
    }
  #+end_src

  In the for loop you can see how the dot product is sequentially
  calculated by multiplying vector values of the same indice and summing the
  result.
  
  To implement this logic in hardware the first thing you need is some way to
  represent a vector which is your first task.
  
** Task 1 - Vector
   The first component you should implement is a register bank for storing a vector.
   This module works as follows:
     #+begin_src scala
    // pseudocode

   let dataOut(T) = if (T - vectorLength) < 0 then 0 else
                      if enableIn(T - vectorLength) 
                        then dataIn(T - vectorLength)
                      else
                        dataOut(T - vectorLength)
         #+end_src      
   From the figure the principle of operation becomes clearer
   
   To test your implementation you can run 
   sbt> testOnly Core.daisyVecSpec 
   in your sbt console
   
#+CAPTION: A vector with 4 registers
[[./tdt4255figs/pngs/vector.png]]
   
** Task 2 - Dot Product
   Your next task is to implement a dot product calculator. daisyDot should
   calculate the dot product of two vectors, inA and inB. Ensure that validOut
   is only asserted when you have a result. Ensure that your accumulator gets
   flushed after calculating your dot product.
   
   Implement the dot product calculator in daisyDot.scala
   
   To test your implementation you can run 
   sbt> testOnly Core.daisyDotSpec
   in your sbt console

** Task 3 - Vector Matrix multiplication
   Having implemented a dot product calculator, a vector matrix multiplier is
   not that different. In imperative code we get something like this:
   
   #+begin_src scala
   type Matrix[A] = List[List[A]]
   def vectorMatrixMultiply(vec: List[Int], matrix: Matrix[Int]): List[Int] = {
     val transposed = matrix.transpose
 
     val outputVector = Array.ofDim[Int](vec.length)
     for(ii <- 0 until matrix.length){
       outputVector(ii) = dotProductForLoop(vec, transposed(ii))
     }
     outputVector.toList
   }
   #+end_src scala
   
   This is just repeated application of dotProduct. Since vector matrix
   multiplication is the dotproduct of the vector and the rows of the matrix,
   the matrix must be transposed.
   The skeleton code contains more hints if this did not make any sense.
   
*** Subtask 1 - representing a matrix
    Like the dot product calculator, the first step is to implement a register
    bank for storing a matrix. This can be done by creating n vectors from Task
    1 and then select which row is the 'current' row.
    
    Implement this in daisyGrid.scala
    
    The matrix representation you have created in this task allows you to select
    which row to read, but not which column. This isn't very efficient when you
    want to read an entire column since you would have to wait a full cycle for
    each row. The way we deal with this is noticing that when multiplying two
    matrices we work on a row basis in matrix A, and column basis on matrix B.
    If we simply transpose matrix B, then accessing its rows is the same as
    accessing the columns of matrix B.
    
    A consequence of this is that the API exposed by your matrix multiplier
    requires matrix B to be transposed.

*** Subtask 2 - vector matrix multiplication
    You now have the necessary pieces to create a vector matrix multiplier.
    Your implementation should have a vector and a matrix (grid).
    Input for the vector is in order, input for the matrix is transposed.
    
    Implement this in daisyVecMat.scala

** Task 4 - Matrix Matrix multiplication
   You can now implement a matrix matrix multiplier.
   You can (and should) reuse the code for this module from the vector matrix
   multiplier.

   Implement this in daisyMatMul.scala
   
   When all tests are green you are good to go.

** Bonus exercise - Introspection on code quality and design choices
   This "exercise" has no deliverable, but you should spend some time thinking about
   what parts gave you most trouble and what you can do to change your approach.
   
   In addition, the implementation you were railroaded into has a flaw that lead to 
   unescessary code duplication when going from a vector matrix multiplier to a matrix 
   matrix multiplier.
   
   Why did this happen, and how could this have been avoided?
