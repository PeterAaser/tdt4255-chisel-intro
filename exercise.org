* Matrix matrix multiplication
  For your first foray into chisel you will design a matrix matrix multiplication unit.
  Matrix multiplication is fairly straight forward, however on hardware it's a little
  trickier than the standard for loops normally employed..
  
  *Important*
  You will be working with skeleton code. Every component you implement has a corresponding
  skeleton source file found in [[./src/main/scala/][src/main/scala/]], so for Vector you're looking for
  [[./src/main/scala/Vector.scala][src/main/scala/Vector.scala]]

  *Important*
  When you are done, use the provided ./deliver.sh script to pack up the archive.
  If you're unable to run bash scripts then please ensure that you deliver a *zip* archive.
  Not .rar or anything else, just use zip because my grading script knows how to handle that
  in addition to the one used by deliver.sh
  named after your username. Nothing more, nothing less, just your username.
  This archive should be runnable as is, thus you need to include all the necessary files.
  (I may or may not diff the tests to check if you're screwing with them)
  
** Task 1 - Vector
   The first component you should implement is a register bank for storing a vector.
   
   In Vector.scala you will find the skeleton code for this component.
   Unlike the standard Chisel.Vec our custom vector has a read enable which means that
   the memory pointed to by idx will only be overWritten when writeEnable is true.

   Implement the vector and test that it works by running
   ~testOnly Ex0.VectorSpec~ in your sbt console.
   
** Task 2 - Matrix
   The matrix works just like the vector only in two dimensions.
   In the skeleton code a row of the vectors you have created in task 1 has been instantiated:
   ~val rows = Vec.fill(rowsDim)(Module(new Vector(colsDim)).io)~
   
   ~rows~ represents a matrix where each element of ~rows~ corresponds to a matrix row, thus
   in order to select an element in the matrix you must first select the correct row, then
   the correct column.
   As an example, consider the following matrix:
   #+begin_src text
       | 2,  5,  5,  0 |
   A = | 7, -1,  X,  3 |
       | 0,  4, -5,  0 |
   #+end_src
   In order to select X we would first select the correct row (1) and drive the index select
   of that row with the desired column (2).
   #+begin_src scala
   rows(1.U).idx := 2.U
   io.dataOut := rows(1.U).dataOut
   #+end_src
   (Keep in mind that this is just to examplify, it is very far from correct and your code
   should not look like this)

   If we wanted to set the value of X to 3 we would have to do something like this:
   #+begin_src scala
   rows(1.U).idx := 2.U
   rows(1.U).writeEnable := true.B
   rows(1.U).dataIn := 3.B
   #+end_src
   
   Keep in mind that these code snippets show manually indexing, but for your circuit you
   want to generalize, which is why we use a for loop.
   For each row, ensure that
   + Write enable is toggled only if the row is currently selected
   + row dataIn is driven by matrix dataIn
     
   Since a vector will only overwrite data when writeEnable is toggled you can drive
   dataIn for all the vectors with the matrix dataIn.

   Run the tests with ~testOnly Ex0.MatrixSpec~
   
** Task 3 - Dot Product
   This component differs from the two previous in that it has no explicit control input,
   which might at first be rather confusing.
   
   With only two inputs for data, how do we know when the dotproduct has been calculated?
   The answer to this is the ~elements~ argument, which tells the dot product calculator the
   size of the input vectors.
   Consequently, the resulting hardware can only (at least on its own) compute dotproducts
   for one size of vector, which is fine in our circuit.
   
   To get a better understanding we can model this behavior in regular scala:

   #+begin_src scala
   case class DotProdCalculator(vectorLen: Int, timeStep: Int, accumulator: Int){
     def update(inputA: Int, inputB: Int): (Int, Boolean, DotProdCalculator) = {
       val product = inputA * inputB
       if(((timeStep + 1) % vectorLen) == 0)
         (accumulator + product, true, this.copy(timeStep = 0, accumulator = 0))
       else
         (accumulator + product, false, this.copy(timeStep = this.timeStep + 1, accumulator = accumulator + product))
     }
   }
   #+end_src

   To see it in action run ~testOnly Examples.SoftwareDotProdSpec~ in your sbt console.
   
   As with the previous tasks, the dot product calculator must pass the tests with
   ~testOnly Ex0.DotProdSpec~
   
*** Timing
    As shown in the timing diagram below, the dot product calculator should deliver the result as
    soon as possible.
    This means you will have to drive the output with the sum of the accumulator and the product of
    the two inputs.
    If you choose to drive the output only by the value of the accumulator your circuit will
    lag behind by one cycle, which while good for pipelining purposes is not good for passing the test
    purposes.

*** Chisel counters and a short detour on scala documentation
    Doing an action for a set amount of timesteps is a very common task in hardware design, so this
    functionality is included in chisel via the Counter class.
    In order to understand how this counter works you can google "chisel counter" and get the following
    https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/api/3.0.1/chisel3/util/Counter.html as first result.
    However, this is for the counter Class, what you actually want is the counter Object: 
    https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/api/3.0.1/chisel3/util/Counter$.html
    (you can click on the methods to get an expanded description)
    
    This can be very confusing when new to scala, but it is simply convention:
    When a class and an object share name this is just a convenience for keeping static methods, such
    as constructors, separated from the non-static methods.

    In the Counter object (the second link) there is an apply method:
    #+begin_src scala
      def apply(cond: Bool, n: Int): (UInt, Bool)
    #+end_src
    The type signature tells you that the input is a regular scala integer, and a chisel boolean
    (scala booleans are of type ~Boolean~, rather than ~Bool~) and the output is a UInt and a chisel
    boolean.
    This means that upon instantiating a Counter with its apply method you only get the outputs from
    the counter, not the object itself.
    The result is a convenient method of making a counter, simply supply how many ticks it takes for the
    counter to roll over, as well as an input signal for enabling the clock, and receive a tuple with the
    signal for the counters value, as well as a boolean signal that toggles whenever the clock rolls over.

    A special property of apply methods are that they can be called directly on the object.
    ~Counter.apply(cCond, 10)~ does the same as ~Counter(cCond, 10)~.
    To call the class constructor, use the ~new~ keyword.


** Task 4 - Matrix Matrix multiplication
   With our matrix modules and dot product calculators we have every piece needed to 
   implement the matrix multiplier.

   When performing matrix multiplication on a computer transposing the second matrix
   can help us reduce complexity by quite a lot. To examplify, consider 
      
   #+begin_src text
       | 2,  5 |
   A = | 7, -1 |
       | 0,  4 |
       

   B = | 1,  1,  2 |
       | 0,  4,  0 |
   #+end_src
   
   It would be much simpler to just have two modules with the same dimensions, and we
   can do this by transposing B so we get
       
   #+begin_src text
        | 2,  5 |
   A  = | 7, -1 |
        | 0,  4 |
       
        | 1,  0 |
   BT = | 1,  4 |
        | 2,  0 |
   #+end_src
   
   Now we need to do is calculate the dot products for the final matrix:

   #+begin_src text
   if A*B = C then

        |  A[0] × BT[0],   A[0] × BT[1],   A[0] × BT[2] |
   C  = |  A[1] × BT[0],   ...         ,   ...          |
        |  ...         ,   ...         ,   A[2] × BT[2] |

   where 
   A[0] × BT[0] is the dot product of [2, 5] and [1, 0]
   and
   A[0] × BT[1] is the dot product of [2, 5] and [1, 4]
   and so forth..
   #+end_src
   
   Because of this, the input for matrix B will be supplied transposed, thus you do not
   have to worry about this. For B the input would be [1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 0].
   
   The skeleton code for the matrix multiplier is less detailed, with only one test.
   You're encouraged to write your own tests to make this easier.
       
*** Structuring your circuit
    It is very easy to get bogged down with details in this exercise, so it's useful to take
    a few moments to plan ahead.
    
    A natural way to break down the task is to split it into two phases: setup and execution.
    For setup you simply want to shuffle data from the input signals to your two matrix modules.
    
    The next task is to actually perform the calculation.
    This is a little more complex, seeing as the read patterns are different from matrix A and B.

    To make this simpler a good idea is to introduce a control module. 
    This module should keep track of which state the multiplier is in, setup or execution, and
    provide the appropriate row and column select signals.
    
    You may also choose to split the control module into an init controller and an execution
    controller if you see fit.

    A suggested design is shown underneath:
    [[./Images/MatMul.png]]
    
*** Timing
    The timing for your matrix multiplier is straight forward. For a 3x4 matrix it takes
    12 cycles to input data (cycles 0 to 11), and execution should proceed on cycle 12.
    While you can technically start execution sooner than this the tests expect you to
    not start executing before all data is loaded.
    As long as you start executing just as data has been loaded your dot prod design will 
    take care of the rest.
    
*** Testing
    In order to make testing easier, consider testing your row and column select signals
    first.
    The actual values stored in the matrixes are just noise, the important part is that
    you select the correct rows and columns at the correct times for the correct matrixes,
    and if you do this the rest is comparatively easy.
    

** Bonus exercise - Introspection on code quality and design choices
   This last exercise has no deliverable, but you should spend some time thinking about
   where you spent most of your efforts.

   A common saying is "A few hours of work can save you from several minutes of planning", 
   and this holds especially true for writing chisel!!
